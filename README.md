     1)Write a program by creating an 'Employee' class having the following methods and print the final salary.
               1 - 'getInfo()' which takes the salary, number of hours of work per day of employee as parameter
               2 - 'AddSal()' which adds $10 to salary of the employee if it is less than $500.
               3 - 'AddWork()' which adds $5 to salary of employee if the number of hours of work per day is more than 6 hours.
     2)=> Create a class called 'Matrix' containing constructor that initializes the number of rows and number of columns of a new                 Matrix object. The Matrix class has the following information:
                1 - number of rows of matrix
                2 - number of columns of matrix
                3 - elements of matrix in the form of 2D array
       =>The Matrix class has methods for each of the following:
                1 - get the number of rows
                2 - get the number of columns
                3 - set the elements of the matrix at given position (i,j)
                4 - adding two matrices. If the matrices are not addable, "Matrices cannot be added" will be                                                 displayed.
       =>multiplying the two matrices

# Practice Problems: Classes and Objects 
  # 1)
     The Java class called Holidayis started below. An object of class Holidayrepresents a holiday during the year. 
     This class has three instance variables:
          name, which is a Stringrepresenting the name of the holiday
          day, which is an intrepresenting the day of the month of the holiday
          month, which is a Stringrepresenting the month the holiday is in

     public class Holiday {

          private String name;
          private int day;
          private String month;

           // your code goes here

     }
     a)	Write a constructor for the class Holiday, which takes a Stringrepresenting the name, an intrepresenting the day,
          and a Stringrepresenting the month as its arguments, and sets the class variables to these values.

     b)	Write a method inSameMonth, which compares two instances of the class Holiday,and returns the Boolean value true
          if they have the same month, and falseif they do not.

     c)	Write a method avgDatewhich takes an array of base type Holidayas its argument, and returns a doublethat is the
          average of the dayvariables in the Holidayinstances in the array. You may assume that the array is full (i.e. does 
          not have any null entries).

     d)	Write a piece of code that creates a Holidayinstance with the name “Independence Day”, with the day “4”, and with
          the month “July”.
   # 2)
          The class Movie is started below. An instance of class Movie represents a film. This class has the following three class variables:

     	title, which is a Stringrepresenting the title of the movie
     	studio, which is a String representing the studio that made the movie
          rating, which is a Stringrepresenting the rating of the movie

          public class Movie {
               private String title;
               private String studio;
               private String rating;
               // your code goes here   
           }
       a)	Write a constructor for the class Movie, which takes a Stringrepresenting the title of the movie, a Stringrepresenting
          the studio, and a Stringrepresenting the rating as its arguments, and sets the respective class variables to these values.

       b)	Write a second constructor for the class Movie, which takes a Stringrepresenting the title of the movie and a
          Stringrepresenting the studio as its arguments, and sets the respective class variables to these values, while the class 
          variable ratingis set to "PG".

     c)	Write a method getPG, which takes an array of base type Movieas its argument, and returns a new array of only those
          movies in the input array with a rating of "PG". You may assume the input array is full of Movieinstances. 
          The returned array need not be full.

     d)	Write a piece of code that creates an instance of the class Moviewith the title “Casino Royale”, the studio “Eon Productions”,    
          and the rating.

          Write a program by creating an 'Employee' class having the following methods and print the final salary.
                1 - 'getInfo()' which takes the salary, number of hours of work per day of employee as parameter
                2 - 'AddSal()' which adds $10 to salary of the employee if it is less than $500.
                3 - 'AddWork()' which adds $5 to salary of employee if the number of hours of work per day is more than 6 hours.
   # 4)
          Create a class called 'Matrix' containing constructor that initializes the number of rows and number of columns of a
               new Matrix object. The Matrix class has the following information:
                1 - number of rows of matrix
                2 - number of columns of matrix
                3 - eleme nts of matrix in the form of 2D array
               The Matrix class has methods for each of the following:
                1 - get the number of rows
                2 - get the number of columns
                3 - set the elements of the matrix at given position (i,j)
                4 - adding two matrices. If the matrices are not addable, "Matrices cannot be added" will be displayed.
                    multiplying the two matrices
